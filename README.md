# curseloop
Small script to loop repairs for a large amount of repositories. 

**Currently Needs to be addressed** 
- Allow the output to be silenced to allow the loop to run through files. 
- Resolve issue where script fails on 2nd command 

> Seems to be issues with the output and how many lines it takes.
